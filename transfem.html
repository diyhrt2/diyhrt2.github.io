        <a id="what_is_hrt"></a>
        <h5> What is HRT? </h5>
        <p>
            HRT stands for hormone replacement therapy.
            <br><br>
            For transfeminine people, this usually means trying to replicate the hormones found in cisgender women.
            People
            who are assigned male at birth (AMAB) will have higher testosterone levels and lower estradiol (estrogen)
            levels
            compared to those assigned female at birth (AFAB).
            <br><br>
            The purpose of HRT is to decrease testosterone levels and raise estradiol levels to levels comparable to
            that of
            healthy cis females. This is usually accomplished using <b>antiandrogens (blocks testosterone and prevents
            masculinization)</b> and <b>estradiol (causes feminization).</b>
        </p>


        <a id="what_does_it_do"></a>
        <h5> What does it do? </h5>
        <p>
            HRT will give a myriad of changes, including breast development, softer skin, fat redistribution more
            similar to
            that of AFAB bodies and a reduction of libido, among many others.
            <br>

                                                                     class="contentImage"></a>
        </p>

        <a id="what_methods"></a>
        <h5> What methods can I get E in? </h5>
        <p>
            There are many forms of HRT and many different kinds of HRT regimens, each with their drawbacks, pros, and
            levels of ease in terms of obtaining them.
            <br><br>
            <b>This section does not cover dosing</b> (see the <b>Dosing</b> section for more information). Given prices
            are
            rough estimates for DIY sourced HRT.
            <br><br>
            <i>Prices below are in $USD. Shipping usually goes between $10-35 USD depending on the source. Best to order
                at
                least several months worth at once to offset the shipping costs.</i>
        </p>

        <h6>Pills - $20-$40 per month ($240-480 per year)</h6>
        <p>
            By far the most popular and well known, pills are the easiest to come by if you choose to DIY.
            Unfortunately,
            they tend to be somewhat expensive. Choose bioidentical estrogens (bioidentical means the pills contain the
            exact same estrogen produced by human bodies).
            <br><br>
            Bioidentical estradiol pills usually come in three forms:<br>
            <b>Estradiol hemihydrate</b> (e.g. Estrofem, Estrace) is equivalent to <b>estradiol</b> (mostly sold by
            homebrewers). <b>Estradiol valerate</b> may also be found in pills. (ex: Progynova) Estradiol valerate has
            about
            75% of the potency of estradiol or estradiol hemihydrate.
            <br><br>
            <b>Avoid non bioidentical estrogens</b> such as Premarin or Ethinylestradiol (EE). These carry elevated
            thromboembolism (blood clot) risks compared to bioidentical estrogens.
            <br><br>
            Pills also tend to be quite convenient to take. Also very easy to acquire if you choose to DIY.
        </p>

        <h7>Oral:</h7>
        <p>
            Oral intake is simply swallowing your pills. Usually twice per day in ~12 hour intervals. Results in more
            stable
            levels versus sublingual/buccal administration.
        </p>

        <h7>Sublingual/Buccal:</h7>
        <p>
            Sublingual intake refers to placing a tablet under the tongue and letting it dissolve, and buccal intake
            refers
            to placing a tablet between your gum and the inside of your cheek to dissolve. These two administration
            methods
            are interchangeable and have essentially the same results.
            <br><br>
            Sublingual/Buccal administration causes higher peak levels of estradiol in the blood that quickly dissipate.
            Because of this, it is recommended that sublingual administration be three (or more) times a day, in 8 hour
            intervals.
        </p>


        <h6>Transdermal - $30-$45 per month ($360-540 per year)(patches)</h6>
        <p>
            Transdermal (estradiol applied to the skin) comes in forms like gels, patches, solutions, etc.
            <br><br>
            <b>Patches</b> are typically switched out once a week and are designed to give out a set dose of estradiol
            every
            day. Usually applied to the lower stomach or upper buttocks.
            <br><br>
            Prescribed <b>gels</b> typically come in packets or in a pump that dispenses a set amount each time.
            Estradiol
            gels are compounded in an alcohol base to increase absorption. Usually applied to the skin once per day.
            Squeeze
            tube style gels that aren't properly dosed are <b>not recommended</b> due to difficulty of accurate dosing.
            Unfortunately most gels available from DIY sources are in this category.
            <br><br>
            <b>Solutions</b> are usually sold from homebrewers, containing estradiol in an alcohol-based solution that
            is
            applied to the skin, usually in an eyedropper style bottle.
            <br><br>
            <b>Estrogen Creams</b> are not very relevant to transfeminine people because of the low absorption rate into
            the
            bloodstream and the difficulty of accurate dosing.
        </p>


        <h6>Injections - $100-$200 per year</h6>
        <p>
            There are certain esters estradiol is commonly compounded in. Estradiol is esterified in order to last
            longer in
            your body.
            <br><br>
            Raw estradiol injected into your tissues will very quickly dissipate, which is why estradiol injections all
            come
            in ester form. It's still just estradiol, your body just slowly converts it into estradiol from its
            esterified
            form.
            <br><br>
            <b>Estradiol valerate, estradiol cypionate and estradiol enanthate</b> are the most commonly prescribed and
            used
            estradiol esters. They all have different half lives (time it lasts inside the body before half the
            medication
            is metabolized).
            <br><br>
            Assuming you inject the same amount of estradiol, esters with shorter half lives mean the levels of
            estradiol in
            your blood and tissues will be higher, but for a shorter period of time.
            <br><br>
            An ester with a longer half life means you will have to inject a bit more to get to those same peak levels,
            but
            also means you can inject less frequently.
            <br><br>
            <b>Estradiol Valerate's (EV)</b> half life is about 3.0 days<br>
            <b>Estradiol Cypionate's (EC)</b> half life is about 6.7 days<br>
            <b>Estradiol Enanthate's (EEn)</b> half life is about 4.6 days. Although research suggests that the peak of
            EEn
            comes later than EC. Essentially, <b>treat EEn as similar to EC</b>, with EEn possibly lasting longer.
            <br><br>
            Valerate is typically prescribed by doctors, with cypionate being occasionally prescribed. Cypionate and
            Enanthate are most commonly found sold by homebrewed estrogen sellers.
        </p>


        <h6>Pellets - N/A</h6>
        <p>
            This cannot be found DIY unless you happen to get it done in a back alley with fake pellets. Don't do that.

            These are more experimental in terms of dosages compared to the other tried and true methods. You can get
            them
            surgically implanted if your insurance covers it. They dissolve E over time and you don't have to worry
            about
            missing a dose. They last about 3-6 months. Most doctors that offer pellets compound them to give a patient
            quite a high dose of estradiol.
        </p>


        <a id="antiandrogens"></a>
        <h5>Antiandrogens</h5>
        <div class="notes">
            <h1>‚ö†Ô∏è Note:</h1>
            <p>All of these should be swallowed unless stated otherwise.</p>
        </div>

        <h6>Spironolactone (AKA Spiro) - $10-20 per month</h6>
        <p>
            Spironolactone is quite a weak antiandrogen, albeit quite safe.
            <br><br>
            Common side effects include increased thirst, salt cravings and frequent urination.
            <br><br>
            Can be taken alongside a regular HRT regimen as an experimental erection-prevention drug if getting
            erections is
            bothersome due to its blood pressure lowering effects (recommend 100-400mg/day¬π for this (start low)).
            <br><br>
            <b>Not recommended as a first choice of antiandrogen due to its weak anti antiandrogenic effects.</b>
            <br><br>
            ‚ùó<i> If you are currently taking spironolactone, and your total testosterone (T) levels are under ~30ng/dL,
            you
            can almost certainly stop taking spiro at that point. The estradiol is doing most of the work of suppressing
            your T. </i>
        </p>

        <h6>Cyproterone acetate (AKA Cyproterone, Cypro) - $5-20 per month</h6>
        <p>
            Cyproterone is a very effective antiandrogen when combined with estrogen.
            <br><br>
            High doses should be avoided due to a harsher risk profile.
            <br><br>
            Keeping under a certain dosage is important, especially considering that cyproterone is usually sold in
            dosages
            4-8 times that of recommended dosages for transfeminine individuals (get a pill cutter!).
        </p>

        <h6>Bicalutamide (AKA Bica) - $15-40 per month</h6>
        <p>
            Bicalutamide is a very effective antiandrogen, moreso when paired with estrogen. It works in a unique way by
            preventing testosterone from having an effect on your body, but it does not actually prevent your body from
            producing testosterone. Ironically, this will increase your blood testosterone levels (your body thinks that
            you
            have zero testosterone inside you and tells your testes to produce even more), but don't worry, all that
            extra
            testosterone can't do anything.
            <br><br>
            People tend to report bica being better at preserving penile function, libido and semen volume better versus
            other antiandrogens.
            <br><br>
            Bicalutamide has about a 1/4000 chance of causing either severe liver or severe lung toxicity. It's strongly
            recommended to get liver function tests every 3 months if you take bicalutamide.
        </p>

        <h6>Estradiol Monotherapy - $100-$200 per year</h6>
        <p>
            High enough levels of estradiol in the body is enough to cause your body's testosterone production to lower
            significantly. This is usually only easily achievable with estradiol injections, which allow a person to
            more
            easily achieve high estradiol levels versus other methods of administration.
            <br><br>
            The vast majority of people on a decent estradiol injection monotherapy regimen (only taking estrogen, no
            antiandrogen) are able to suppress testosterone levels adequately without needing to take antiandrogens.
        </p><br>


        <a id="side_effects_risks"></a>
        <h5>Side Effects/risks:</h5>
        <br>
        <div class="notes">
            <h1>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note:</h1>
            <p>When you google a medication talked about here, you will probably see a massive list of side effects, in
                the
                context of antiandrogens, most of these effects (like hot flashes, fatigue, bone density loss, etc.) are
                actually just side effects of sex hormone deprivation seen in cis men who take antiandrogens without an
                estrogen for the treatment of prostate cancer. You will not see the effects of sex hormone deprivation
                if
                you take estrogen with your antiandrogens.</p>
            <h7>All forms of HRT will likely make you infertile, possibly irreversibly.</h7>
            <br><br>
        </div>
        <p> All recommended tests mentioned in this section can be tested from blood samples taken during a regular
            blood
            test. You don't have to get fancy expensive tests. </p>

        <h6>Estradiol</h6>
        <p>
            <b>All forms of estrogens will increase your risk of blood clots</b> (thromboembolism), including serious
            blood
            clots (e.g. deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism). The likelihood of this is still very low in absolute
            risk
            but it is present. <b>The risk of getting blood clots on HRT is essentially comparable to that of cis
            women</b>
            if you take a modest HRT regimen.
            <br><br>
            Higher levels of estradiol means higher blood clot risk.
            <br><br>
            Assuming the exact same blood levels of estradiol, taking oral estradiol will carry a higher risk of causing
            blood clots versus other forms of administration (due to oral estradiol passing through the liver).
            <br><br>
            However, because of the higher levels of estradiol in your blood that other methods usually result in
            (transdermal, injections, etc.), the unique risks of oral estradiol aren't particularly relevant in
            practice.
        </p>

        <h6>Spironolactone:</h6>
        <p>
            The main reason I recommend against spironolactone is because spiro is a very weak antiandrogen. There are
            just
            better options out there.
            <br><br>
            However, it's very safe, but common side effects include increased thirst, salt cravings and frequent
            urination
            due to it being a diuretic (makes your body get rid of water faster).
            <br><br>
            Spiro is also known to reduce blood pressure, which can make it hard for some people to attain erections.
            <br>
            Ideally you should get U&E (urea and electrolytes) tested for (see if you're dehydrated, basically) if you
            are
            on spiro.
        </p>

        <h6>Cyproterone acetate:</h6>
        <p>
            Extremely high doses of cyproterone, mostly found above 50mg/day and 100mg/day can cause a myriad of
            different
            harsh side effects and risks, mainly prolactinomas and meningiomas (small benign brain tumors).
            <br><br>
            At dosages relevant to transfeminine people (6.25-12.5mg/day) the risk profile is much different. The same
            risks
            are still present but much lower at smaller doses.
            <br><br>
            Cyproterone is also known to slightly increase blood clot risk, although the increase in risk is quite low
            at
            dosages used in trans people.
            <br><br>
            Cypro may increase the risk of B12 deficiency and slightly increase depression risk. Despite the relative
            safety
            at these doses, ideally you should still get prolactin (PRL) and B12 tested to make sure it's within a
            healthy
            range. These risks are cumulative (risks gradually get higher the longer you stay on cyproterone).
        </p>

        <h6>Bicalutamide:</h6>
        <p>
            Due to dysphoria, some transfeminine people do not want to experience a higher libido and an easier time
            getting
            erections. These are things that bica tends to preserve better than other antiandrogens. Some may see this
            as a
            beneficial effect, however.
            <br><br>
            The main risk of bicalutamide is severe liver toxicity and lung toxicity. The chances of either happening
            are
            about 1/4000. Risk of liver toxicity can be monitored if you get regular liver function tests every 3 months
            or
            so (done by analyzing blood from a regular blood test sample).
            <br><br>
            After a year of normal liver function tests, you can stop taking them. The risks of bicalutamide after a
            period
            of time with no side effects are known to not be cumulative <b>(you can confidently assume that your risk of
            lung/liver toxicity will not increase over time if it's already been a period of time without symptoms)</b>.
            The
            risk of both lung and liver toxicity is essentially zero after a year without issues.
            <br><br>
            Out of the millions of men who have taken bicalutamide for prostate cancer treatment, there have been a few
            reported cases where bicalutamide induced a severe light sensitivity condition. Again, the risk for this
            does
            not seem to be cumulative after a period of time with no symptoms.
            <br><br>
            Despite these possible side effects, the absolute risk of any severe outcomes occurring on bicalutamide is
            extremely low. With the added benefit that bica has essentially no common side effects like spiro or cypro.

        <h6>GNRH Agonists:</h6>
        <p>
            If you have already gone through an AMAB/testosterone puberty, you will experience a temporary flareup of
            testosterone when you start taking a GNRH agonist for the first time. If you want to avoid this temporary T
            flare up, you can take cyproterone or bicalutamide for the first 3 weeks of use.

        <p>
            <b>‚ÄúLegit HRT/Pharmaceutical Grade‚Äù</b> - Refers to <b>HRT produced by legitimate pharmaceutical
            companies</b>
            that are licensed and subject to regulation. They are the same quality as those found in your local
            pharmacy.
            They can be ordered without a prescription from websites based in countries that allow for the legal
            exportation
            of such medications. These will almost always carry less inherent risk versus homebrewed hormones.
            <br><br>
            <b>‚ÄúDIY/Homebrewed‚Äù</b> - Refers to <b>HRT produced by individuals, by sourcing raw estradiol
            ester/bicalutamide/etc powder and compounding the medication themselves.</b> They do not synthesize (create
            from
            scratch) hormones. While the concept sounds scary, there are a couple well respected members of the
            community
            that produce high quality and safe HRT medications.

            your
            well being.

        <h6> Prescribed HRT: </h6>
        <p>
            If you are in the <b>US</b>: you can try informed consent (Planned Parenthood locations offer this service),
            or
            any endo that allows it. Informed consent is essentially an easier method of obtaining HRT without having to
            prove your transness, or be actually diagnosed with gender dysphoria. You just sign a consent form and
            that's
            it.
            <br><br>
            <b>You have to be 18+ to access informed consent services in the USA.</b>

        <h6>DIY:</h6>
        <p>
            If you do not want to be on waitlists, have to prove your transness while allowing your body to masculinize,
            or
            are unable to get HRT legally, DIY may be preferable. Depending on where you order from, you may need to
            find
            out how to buy Bitcoin/other cryptocurrencies or find a way to send an international bank transfer,
            Moneygram,
            etc. Ordering from a homebrewer may avoid dealing with more frustrating payment methods.
        </p>
        <h7> Note on HRT dosing:</h7>
        <p><b><i> For regimens with antiandrogens:</b><br>
            There is usually no reason to start HRT on a lower than normal dose of antiandrogen, you should go directly
            into
            a typical dose of antiandrogen and adjust accordingly if needed.
            <br><br>
            <b>For regimens with oral or sublingual/buccal estradiol:</b></i><br>
            To accurately dose pills you may need to buy a pill cutter (Amazon or any local pharmacy works). Check your
            HRT
            source to see if your pills need to be split a certain way for your preferred dosages.
            <br><br>
            <i><b>Any regimen:</b><br>
                There's no strong evidence to suggest that starting on a low dose of estradiol and slowly raising your
                dose
                is necessarily better than starting on a moderate dose. There are anecdotes and theories floating around
                that suggest that you may get better breast development or feminization if you start low and slowly ramp
                up
                your dose. Despite the lack of clinical data and evidence, there's no real harm in doing this. Feel free
                to
                experiment if you wish.
            </i></p>

        <h6>Antiandrogen + estradiol dosing:</h6>
        <p><i>The following example regimens use typical doses of estradiol on the higher end of what would be
            considered a
            moderate dose. Adjust accordingly if you have access to blood testing (see blood testing section above).</i>
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h7>Cyproterone acetate:</h7>
        <p><i><b>If you take cyproterone, you will need a pill cutter!</b> (Pill cutters are sold at any pharmacy over
            the
            counter or online from sites like Amazon). Cyproterone tablets are almost always 25mg-50mg tablets (way over
            a
            recommended dose). Not recommended to go above 12.5mg of cyproterone daily. <b>Increase estrogen dosage</b>
            if
            testosterone is not adequately suppressed instead.</i>
            <br><br>
            <b>Oral estradiol:</b></p>
        <li>6.25-12.5mg cyproterone acetate taken once a day</li>

        <br><br>
        <h7>Bicalutamide:</h7>
        <p><i>Reminder! Bicalutamide causes blood testosterone levels to increase, so even though your T may be
            adequately
            blocked, your testosterone levels on a blood test will likely show quite high levels. Bicalutamide also has
            a
            long half life, which means it doesn't really matter what time you take it every day, as long as you take it
            every day. 50mg is almost always enough to ensure adequate testosterone suppression when combined with
            estradiol.</i></p>

        <p><i>Buserelin (sometimes sold as the brand name ‚ÄòSuprefact') has a short half life, so it should be
            administered
            three times a day to be effective. You can double the recommended dose of Buserelin during the first week to
            counteract the testosterone flare effect that GNRH Agonists have. Alternatively, you can take cyproterone or
            bicalutamide for the first three weeks on Buserelin.

        <h6>Monotherapy dosing/Accurate injection dosing:</h6>
        <p>
            <b>Here are some reasonable dosages for estradiol injections used in transfeminine hormone therapy:</b>
        </p>
        <li><b>Estradiol Valerate (EV):</b> 4mg every 5 days (0.1mL, assuming a 40mg/mL vial)</li>
        <li><b>Estradiol Cypionate (EC):</b> 5mg every 7 days (~0.13mL, assuming a 40mg/mL vial)</li>
        <li><b>Estradiol Enanthate (EEn):</b> 7mg every 10 days (~0.18mL, assuming a 40mg/mL vial)‚Åµ</li>
        <p>
            <i>These dosages should give the vast majority of people high enough estradiol levels to suppress
                testosterone
                on its own.
                <br><br>
                Adjust accordingly if you have access to blood testing (see blood testing section above). Ideally you
                should
                be aiming for the lowest possible estradiol levels (that are still above 100pg/mL) that still adequately
                suppress testosterone <50ng/dL at trough. Though people usually require trough estradiol levels of
                200-250pg/mL to adequately suppress testosterone.</i>
            <br><br>
            Vials of estradiol are usually compounded at either 5mg/mL, 10mg/mL, 20mg/mL or 40mg/mL.
            <br><br>
            This means that for a 40mg/mL vial, every 1mL of liquid will contain 40mg of estradiol. A 40mg/mL 10mL vial
            will
            then contain a total of 400mg of estradiol.
            <br><br>
            Homebrewed vials are usually compounded at 40mg/mL.<br>
            We will unfortunately be doing some math here.
            <br><br>
            The formula to calculate how much liquid to inject is: <b>(amount you want to inject) √∑ (concentration of
            the
            vial) = amount to inject per dose in mL</b>
        </p>

        <h7> How to perform an E injection:</h7>
        <p>
            <b>Cost of needles/syringes</b> - $1-$3 dollars per injection/$50-160 per year (depends on how much you buy
            at a
            time). Check out <a href="injectionsupplies" target="_blank">our sources for good Injection Supplies
            here.</a>
            <br><br>
            Needles can be bought from any pharmacy over the counter in most countries without a prescription (you may
            have
            to ask the pharmacist directly).
            <br><br>
            Most countries also have online sites that sell appropriate injection needles. Amazon is a popular source
            for
            those in America. <br>
            You can also check medical supply sites, which usually have the cheapest prices if buying large quantities.
            <br><br>
            <b>Make sure to buy 1mL syringes,</b> as the small amounts of fluid we are using for each injection are only
            easily measured with 1mL syringes. The more common 3mL syringes will still work if you cannot find 1mL
            syringes,
            but are not ideal.
            <br><br>
            There are two methods for an E injection, <b>subcutaneous/subq</b>‚Å∂ (injection into the layer of fat under
            the
            skin), and <b>intramuscular/IM</b> (injection deep into the muscle underneath the skin and fat). Both
            methods
            result in identical absorption rates and levels of the drug, whether you prefer subq or IM is mostly
            personal
            preference.
            <br><br>
            <b>Homebrewed injections usually hurt less if injected intramuscularly (due to the solvents used in
                manufacturing).</b><br>
            Appropriate gauges (needle thickness) for a subcutaneous injection are 25-30g, for intramuscular, 23-25g.
            Subq
            needles are thinner than IM needles, which some people find less intimidating.
            <br><br>
            Recommended needle lengths are as follows:<br>
            1‚Äù-1 ¬Ω‚Äù (IM, 1 inch is better for thinner people and 1 ¬Ω‚Äù for thicker people)<br>
            ¬Ω‚Äù-‚Öù‚Äù (Subq, up to personal preference)<br>
            <br><br>
            <b>There are many online videos and guides for how to administer an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection,
                here are a few decent ones:</b>

        <a id="FAQ"></a>
        <h5>Frequently Asked Questions:</h5>
        <h6>Why do you recommend such low estradiol dosages/levels?</h6>
        <p>
            There's no clinical evidence that higher estradiol levels results in better breast development/feminization
            or a
            quicker transition. The main factor that determines how quickly breast growth or feminization occurs is
            adequate
            suppression of testosterone.
        </p>
        <h6>No mention of progesterone (AKA prog)?</h6>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, there's a lack of clinical evidence that progesterone has any relevant effects in
            transfeminine
            people. Despite this, many people have anecdotally reported that progesterone usage resulted in better
            breast
            development, higher libido, better feminization, mood changes, etc. Progesterone does have potentially
            desirable
            antiandrogenic effects.
            <br><br>
            Notwithstanding the lack of evidence for these often-shared anecdotal claims, there are no serious risks of
            experimenting with progesterone if you so desire. Of note is that oral progesterone is mostly destroyed by
            the
            liver. The bioavailability (how much of the medication actually goes into your bloodstream and tissues) of
            oral
            progesterone is less than 2.4%.
            <br><br>
            In order for progesterone to be maximally effective, rectal administration is recommended. This
            significantly
            increases bioavailability of progesterone.<br>
            <b>100mg-200mg</b> of rectal prog daily is a typical dose. Most people take rectal prog before bed.
        </p>
        <h6>Powers method/Estrone (E1) levels?</h6>
        <p>
            Dr. Will Powers is a trans healthcare provider very well known in the trans community. He has made many
            claims
            about HRT and has a number of unique practices regarding the HRT regimens he prescribes.
            <br><br>
            <b>There's very little evidence to suggest that Powers' methods are any better at attaining
                quicker/better/faster feminization or breast development versus a typical HRT regimen.</b> There is no
            clinical evidence that suggests his estrone theory (higher E1 levels during the start of transition with
            oral
            estradiol causing better breast growth) works any better than other HRT regimens.
            <br><br>
            The reason Powers' patients tend to get better results is because he prescribes regimens and adjusts levels
            based on blood testing so that the patient's hormone levels are actually within reasonable ranges, which is
            already quite rare for any trans healthcare provider to do.
            <br><br>
            <a href="https://transfemscience.org/articles/powers-fact-check/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Much
                of what Powers claims/says are mostly unfounded</a>, and there is much evidence in the contrary for many
            of
            his claims. This includes his claims about boron, progesterone, the ‚ÄòPowers' method', etc.
            <br><br>
            Despite this, there are some things that Powers has done that are worthy of praise, namely the use of
            bicalutamide as an antiandrogen for transfems, using high dose estradiol monotherapy, using rectal
            progesterone
            instead of oral, etc.
        </p>
        <h6>What's the best way of knowing my T levels if I can't get a blood test done?</h6>
        <p>
            <b>Content Warning: NSFW mentions of AMAB genitals</b>
            <br><br>
            There are really no good ways to find out if your T levels are suppressed if you can't access blood tests.
            <br><br>
            If you ejaculate no or very little semen when you orgasm, it's a likely sign that your T is very adequately
            suppressed. However, being able to ejaculate semen doesn't necessarily mean your T isn't being suppressed.
            <br><br>
            If you notice your libido being significantly higher than normal, an increase in acne/oil production, more
            random erections, and increased semen volume, it can be a sign that your testosterone is too high.
            <br><br>
            Try and avoid relying on very subjective factors like changes in mood to gauge hormone levels.
        </p>
        <h6>Do I have to worry about DHT?</h6>
        <p>
            DHT is an androgen that causes facial/body hair growth and contributes to male-pattern baldness.
            <br><br>
            I did not mention DHT in the main guide because:<br>
            1) I felt that there would have been too much information in an already info-dense article.<br>
            2) HRT regimens that will block/suppress/prevent the effects of testosterone will also do the same for DHT.
            Usually it's not something people should worry about.<br>
            <br><br>
            You can get your DHT tested with a blood test to see if it's too high (I would consider anything >20 ng/dL
            to be
            high), and add in 0.5mg daily dutasteride (<a href="https://hrt.cafe/dutasteride" target="_blank"
                                                          rel="noopener noreferrer">hrt.cafe/dutasteride</a>) to block
            DHT.
        </p>
        <h6>Is this illegal?</h6>
        <p>
            Ordering these medications almost always carries zero risk of legal consequence. This is because in most
            countries, estrogens and antiandrogens are not controlled substances that are illegal to order or possess.
            <br><br>
            However, because ordering medication online without a prescription is unregulated, packages may still be
            seized
            by customs (essentially the border police that look through mail) and destroyed. Customs seizure is rare
            though,
            and most sellers will resend a package for free or refund an order if it is seized.
            <br><br>
            This is how the law works in most countries (including the USA, Canada, UK, EU, most South American
            countries,
            Australia, etc).
            <br><br>
            However, ordering from a domestic source (usually homebrew sources) will carry essentially zero risk of
            seizure,
            because domestic mail does not pass through customs.
            <br><br><br>
            <i>
                <b>Some countries, especially in the Middle East like the UAE, do classify HRT medication as a
                    controlled
                    substance.</b><br>
                Research the laws in your country if you are not certain.<br><br>
                <b>‚Ü≥ What do I do if my package is seized?</b><br>
                In the unlikely event your package is held by customs and you are contacted by phone or email, <b>do not
                tell customs what is inside the package.</b><br>
                If they contact you (usually you are only contacted if you provide your contact information to an
                overseas
                pharmacy source), know that you cannot get in legal trouble for ordering HRT. Contact the seller if
                possible
                to resolve the issue.<br>
                It is bad for people who want to order from a specific seller, and bad for that seller's business if you
                tell customs that you're ordering HRT without a prescription. Don't do that.
            </i>
        </p>
        <h6>Traveling with HRT.</h6>
        <p>
            Yes it's fine to travel with most HRT. Even with weeks worth of needles and injection supplies. You'll
            almost
            certainly be fine.
            <br><br>
            For air travel, <b>be sure your HRT is clearly labeled as what it actually is</b> (write the full name of
            the
            medication on the bottle/vial/etc if you need to). Don't try to take wrongly labeled HRT onto a plane, for
            example, putting HRT pills into a vitamin bottle. If you use injections, store it in your checked baggage.
            <br><br>
            If you want to be extra safe, throw a bottle of Aspirin and some allergy medication into a large, clear
            Ziploc
            bag along with your HRT.

        <h6>Is weight cycling real/worth it?</h6>
        <p>
            <b>Content Warning: Food, Weight, Eating Disorders.</b>
            <br><br>
            Weight cycling is an idea popular in some transfeminine communities. It is the idea that losing weight if
            you
            are a heavier person pre-HRT, or gaining some weight if you were a skinnier person pre-HRT can help in
            obtaining
            a more feminine figure/feminine fat distribution and will enhance breast development.
            <br><br>
            The concept of weight cycling makes intuitive sense, but <b>there has been no research on the subject.</b>
            Feel
            free to try if you want, just don't hurt yourself or give yourself an eating disorder.
            <br><br>
            More extreme forms of weight cycling involve repeatedly gaining and losing significant amounts of weight. I
            would not recommend this.
        </p>
        <h6>Do I have to change my HRT regimen if I get an orchiectomy or bottom surgery/SRS?</h6>
        <br>
        <h7>Had an orchiectomy(orchi)/bottom surgery/SRS?</h7>
        <p>
            If you no longer have testes, you can take a lower dose of estrogen without an antiandrogen, because your
            body
            no longer produces significant amounts of testosterone or other androgens, thus negating the need for an
            antiandrogen. Below are some more tailored HRT regimens for those who have had an orchi or bottom
            surgery/SRS:

                total of 100mg per day, or 100mg twice a day for 200mg per day, etc.) </p>
            <p>¬≤ Supported by evidence in men who take bicalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer. Bica tends to
                preserve sex drive better in this population versus other antiandrogens, which can probably be
                extrapolated
                to trans populations.</p>
            <p>¬≥ However, I strongly recommend regular blood tests (every 3 months) to get liver function tests (LFT)
                <b>if
                    you are taking bicalutamide</b>, due to the extremely low but still present risk of severe liver
                toxicity.
                You can stop these tests after about a year or so (if your liver enzymes are normal on bica after a year
                you're fine). </p>
            <p>‚Å¥ Most private blood testing lets you print off a requisition form, which you can bring to a local blood
                lab
                to get your blood drawn. You don't have to mail anything in or take your blood at home.</p>
            <p>‚Åµ If you prefer easier-to-measure amounts, try these alternate dosages:<br>
                <b> Estradiol Cypionate (EC):</b> 6mg every 7 days (0.15mL, assuming a 40mg/mL vial)<br>
                <b> Estradiol Enanthate (EEn):</b> 8mg every 10 days (0.20mL, assuming a 40mg/mL vial)
